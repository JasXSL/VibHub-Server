											// When sent to the server, the first byte is the device to send to. This byte is removed when forwarded to the device.
											// Received by: Server from App / Device from Server

	TASK_PWM_SPECIFIC : "ps",				// (string)hex_pwm_bytes | Similar to above, but ports are specified, hex bytes are in the order of: deviceIndex, port_id,pwm, port_id2,pwm2...
											// The leftmost bit (0x80) in deviceIndex is reserved as a "high res" flag. When set, you use 2 bytes for PWM where the leftmost is MSB. Ex: 00(devIdx) 80(port0,hiRes) 0FFF(max intensity for a 12bit device)  
											// Received by: Server from App / Device from Server

											// Received by: Device from Server
	
	TASK_ADD_DEVICE : "id",					// {id:(str)id, ...meta} OR (str)id | Adds a device to the server, allowing apps to send data to it.
											// Always pass an object with meta if you have the memory for it
											// See DeviceInfo.js in the server docs for the viable meta fields
											// Received by: Server from Device
	
	TASK_ADD_APP : "app",					// (str)name | Send from an app to add or update the app name. name is limited to 128 bytes 
											// If a device disconnects, you'll have to send this again to send the app name to the device.
											// This call is also automatically sent to any devices currently connected to the app, and also from TASK_HOOKUP / TASK_HOOKDOWN
											// When forwarded it gets the argument: [(str)appName, (str)appConnectionID]
											// Received by: Server from App

	TASK_WHOIS : "whois",					// (str)id | Gets meta information about a device
											// Received by: Server from App

	TASK_APP_OFFLINE : "app_offline",		// (str)appName, (str)connectionID | Automatically sent to all devices the app was connected to whenever the app goes offline.
											// Received by: Device from Server

	TASK_HOOKUP : "hookup",					// (str/arr)deviceIDs | Send from an app to hook up to a device and send PWM tasks
											// This also sends the TASK_ADD_APP command to the device(s)
											// Received by: Server from App

	TASK_HOOKDOWN : "hookdown",				// (str/arr)deviceName | Send from an app stop sending PWM tasks
											// Received by: Server from App

	TASK_DEVICE_ONLINE : "dev_online",		// (str)id, (str)socketID, (obj)meta | Automatically sent to all apps that have hooked up to a device whenever it comes online
											// Received by: App from Server
	
	TASK_DEVICE_OFFLINE : "dev_offline",	// (str)id, (str)socketID | Automatically sent to all apps that have hooked up to a device whenever it goes offline
											// Received by: App from Server

	TASK_CUSTOM_TO_DEVICE : "dCustom",		// (str)deviceID, (var)custom_data | Forwards custom data to an app connected to the device it's sent from by name
											// Received by the device on success: (str)appName, (str)socketID, (var)custom_data
											// Received by: Server from App, Device from Server

	TASK_CUSTOM_TO_APP : "aCustom",			// (str)socketID, (var)custom_data | Forwards custom data to a device connected to the app by app socketID. For this to work, the app must be named via TASK_ADD_APP
											// Received by the app on success: (str)deviceID, (str)socketID, (var)custom_data
											// Received by: Server from Device, App from Server

	TASK_GET : "GET",						// {id:(str)deviceID, type:(str)type, data:(obj)data} | Emulates a REST request with websocket. Uses the same structure.
											// Received by: Server from App

	TASK_BATTERY_REQ : "gb",				// {id:(str)deviceID/appID} | Requests battery status from a device. Note that devices have to have the TASK_BATTERY_STATUS capability in order to reply.
											// Received by: Server from App, Device from Server. DeviceID is replaced with appID on the server to designate the app to reply to.
	
	TASK_BATTERY_STATUS : "sb",				// {low:(bool)battery_is_low, mv:(int)millivolts, mx:(int)millivolts_max, app:(str)appID*, id:(str)deviceID*} | Requests/replies with battery status. If id is not supplied, it will reply to ALL apps.
											// Received by: App from Server (deviceID is supplied), Server from Device (if appID is specified, it replies to a specific app, provided the app has this device, otherwise it resplies to ALL apps that have this device).
	TASK_HIGHRES : "h",						// void | Not an endpoint, used to mark that we're able to use high resolution in vib/ps/p.
											// Received by: Server from Device. Capability data will be nr of bits supported.
